This folder is used to store the dataset for the neural network models. The folder structure of the dataset is as follows:

|--dataset/
   |--train/
      |--syn/
         000001.jpg
         000002.jpg
         ...
      |--target/
         000001.jpg
         000002.jpg
         ...
   |--test/
      |--syn/
         000001.jpg
         000002.jpg
         ...
      |--target/
         000001.jpg
         000002.jpg
         ...

In the `dataset`, there are three main subfolders: `train`, `validation`, and `test`. 

The `train` folder contains subfolders for each class in the dataset, where the images belonging to that class are stored.
The `test` folder contains the images that are used to evaluate the trained model's performance.

Each image in the dataset is typically represented as a file (e.g., `000001.jpg`, `000002.jpg`) within the corresponding class folder.
